# What?
This is an app for geeks that like to do their own geocaching-like rallye. Therefore you have to set your own quests. Each quest has a GPS location and a task (for ex. a question). Once the user is near to the location the question is reveilled. She/He can now input the answer and the next quest with a new location gets activated. The GPS coordinates are hidden the whole time by purpose: You only have a compass direction and the distance to the target location. This is trickier than searching a position on a map.

# Create your own rallye with friend
1. Clone this project, open it with ADT (compilation with Android v4.1.2 preferred)
2. Open data/Quests.java and create your quests (follow the instructions in that file)
3. Compile and test, share the app with you friends and have a nice georallye-adventure
